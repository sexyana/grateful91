             <p>These past nights, I've been up and awake till 3am. I just finished watching online videos made by Clinton Sparks, in this 3-day workshop. It was about understanding music as a business and how to get started with it. Before I decided to pursue music as a career, I knew that it was going to be the biggest investment of my life.</p>

                 <p>Just last month, I spent over $1,000 on FL Studio, a midi keyboard, headphones, microphone, accessories and online courses. This month, I've already gone through $500 on paperwork fees. After figuring the numbers out, I was speechless. I can't believe I'm going through with this.</p>
                 <p>I spent all my time in the month of April getting to know Fl Studio, finding my rhythm and making beats. I bought two courses that showed me the basics and tips of how to use it. I watched videos on youtube. I searched through Instagram looking for beatmakers. I signed up and watched a video on selling beats by Robin Wesley. With everything that I had, I played around with the DAW and made 5 different beats.

                     At first, I was going for the electronic and hip-hop style. Then, I was writing lyrics and trying to emulate songs by Alicia Keys and Cannons. It didn't work out too well. I started taking a course to learn how to play piano. It was fun, but I stopped practicing and ended up with these 5 beats that proved to me just how amazing and frustrating it is to become a pro at making music. I even wrote a song for "Gone Like Summer" and recorded it a million times. The result did not turn out well, but I learned a bit about vocal mixing and plugins. With all that done...
                 </p>
                 <p>I went into May with a different perspective. First of all, I'm not Alicia Keys. I can't make beats like Cannons or DJ Snake. <strong>I can't,</strong> but what I can do is be me. So, I sat down at my desk. Beginning a new beat scared me because I never knew what to start with. This time around, I picked a drum sample, a sythn for the chords and a bass. I put a few patterns together and in a matter of minutes, I had a rhythm. The melody gave me an unexpected vibe that strangely resonated with me. I opened notepad and literally, the lyrics wrote itself.</p>
                 <p>I wrote, recorded, produced and completed my first real song in the first week of May. I spent all day getting the vocals and lyrics right. I experimented with a new plugin that was driving me crazy in the first 2 days, but I had to know it because it <em>produced</em> the sound I wanted.</p>
                 <p>The song is inspired by my friends or, as I refer to them in the song, my homegirls.</p>
