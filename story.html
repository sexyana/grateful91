			 <p><span class="highlight">I want a basketball player</span> 🏀 | Sat, February 26, 2022</p>
			 <p>A few years ago, I worked at a plant where I met a very tall girl. We became friends and started hanging out together. We hated working at the plant because the hours were long, the pay was low, and nearly all the men were discriminative. It didn't take me long to realize that I didn't belong there.<br><br>

One day, I went out and about to try something new. Everything went well, so I introduced the new gig to my friend. She gave it a try, did well, and admitted that it wasn't alright with her. After confessing a few things, she told me, "I want a basketball player.". Honestly, I didn't have positive feelings towards her when she said this to me because one, I didn't care for sports, and two, I was thinking, <em>"What NBA player would want you?"</em>. She's didn't exercise, eat right or try to maintain good habits. I said, "Okay." and left it at that. A few weeks later, I stopped showing up for work, and our friendship ended without any need for closure.<br><br>

Today, basketball is the only sport that I love. I love the Miami Heat and have been crushing on <span class="highlight">Caleb Martin.</span> I look at his pictures all the time. Meanwhile, I think back to my friend at the plant and what she said about wanting a basketball player. I never looked into the salary or lifestyle of an NBA player until now. I never even thought about dating an NBA player because the height difference was too much to consider, but I realize now that I can always buy a pair of five-inch heels.<br><br>If I were a basketball player, I'd probably have many women but no children. I'd be so high on money and life that the gift of being talented, handsome, and alive would greatly outweigh all the love that any woman claims to have for me.<br><br><span class="line highlight">I want a basketball player.</span> I'd rather be one instead.
