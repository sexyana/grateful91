			 <p>Rainy Days | Fri, February 25, 2022</p>
			 <p>It took me 29 years to realize how lucky I am to <strong>be who I am,</strong> and not from the validation of others, but from my willingness to trust in God.<br><br>I used to get mad with previous boyfriends at how they'd look at other women while being out with me. I would let friends embarrass me when we were out because I knew it made them feel better about themselves. I let everyone step all over me and convince me that I was nothing without them. Eventually, I broke off from everybody, found myself completely alone, and began my journey to womanhood.<br><br>God was always present in my life, giving me signs about my judgment and the people in my circle. I chose not to listen and got burned pretty badly. As soon as I realized it, I apologized, confessed, and had a heart-to-heart with God, outside in the rain, under an umbrella. That was years ago and is still one of the most painful memories of my life. I think back to it when I get in late from work and stay up till 5 AM because I can't sleep.</p>

			 <p>Big Booty Baby 🍑 | Thurs, February 17, 2022</p>
			 <p>I can't wait to get a juicy, plump, peach booty! I searched for some exercises that I could do to help my butt grow. These exercises increase the glute muscles and include squatting, jumping, and bending with weights. According to various articles and trainers, I can expect to see results in as little as four months.<br><br><em>In a vivid dream: I am in Miami, wearing a scandalous V thong bikini. I walk up a set of stairs to a pool party and shake my butt to Tupac's California song.</em><br><br>By the time my butt looks like it may explode, the rest of my body will be lean, tan, and sculpted. I might consider getting a personal trainer's certification, going to nude beaches, and making an account on Only Fans. I'll go jogging in tight shorts every morning. I'll wear exotic, short dresses that hug my hips and flatter my butt. When I go out to crowded places, I want my butt to be so big that it bumps into people without even bouncing. Everywhere I go, my butt will demand the attention it deserves. Glute exercises are tiring and not very fun, so once I get this booty to be as big as a blimp, you won't be able to miss it!</p>
