			 <p>⏰ <strong>Did you clock in?</strong>| Wed, March 2, 2022</p>
			 <p>I'm getting older and I still can't figure it out. I guess my fear is getting stuck with something that I don't like to do, only because it pays enough. I've been in my practice for almost three years and it's the only thing that I've done for this long. I've never stayed longer than a year at any previous job. It's not that I'm lazy or unwilling to work and save money, like a regular person. It's because:</p>
			 <ul>
				 <li>Supervisors are unfair</li>
				 <li>Co-workers are negative</li>
				 <li>Work schedule has no balance</li>
				 <li>There's no room for growth</li>
				 <li>The pay is not equal to the job's demand</li>
				 <li>Same thing every day</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>In the past, people said things about me and indirectly, all the time. For example:</p>
			 <ul>
				 <li>You've had many jobs because you can't a job</li>
				 <li>You're the stupidest person in the whole world</li>
				 <li>You're not gonna make it</li>
				 <li>That job isn't for you</li>
				 <li>You can't eat if you don't work</li>
				 <li>And a whole bunch of irrelevant comments</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>Sometimes, I was pushing it on purpose to see what management would do. I would come to work late and never in uniform every day. I never got written up or fired, and all my co-workers couldn't stand me. Anyway, I've offended many people at past jobs with my attitude. Why should I be committed to working, barely earning enough to buy noodles while earning a fortune for someone else? It's crazy how many people go to work and never question the process. Instead, they clock in, complain, try to laugh about it, live on a budget, and then do it all over again. There are myriads of circumstances and scenarios out there. I understand the disagreement, frustration, and unfairness. I support what people feel they need to do to survive. As for myself, and considering all the decisions I've made up until this point, I want an unfamiliar path that will take me somewhere new.</p>
			 <p>I never got used to working for someone else, handling aggressive customers, or being in a team with haters, so I asked myself: What would I do? I'm not afraid to take risks. I'm blessed enough to say that it doesn't concern me too much to miss a few days or weekends of making money when I'm devoting that time to learning something new, reading, or researching. I am positive that there is something perfect for me, but before I find it, I'll have to go through all these ideas, one by one, to get some perception.</p>

			 <p><span class="pink">I want a basketball player</span> 🏀 | Sat, February 26, 2022</p>
			 <p>A few years ago, I worked at a plant where I met a very tall girl. We became friends and started hanging out together. We hated working at the plant because the hours were long, the pay was low, and nearly all the men were discriminative. It didn't take me long to realize that I didn't belong there.</p>

<p>One day, I went out and about to try something new. Everything went well, so I introduced the new gig to my friend. She gave it a try, did well, and admitted that it wasn't alright with her. After confessing a few things, she told me, "I want a basketball player.".<br>Honestly, I didn't have positive feelings towards her when she said this to me because one: I didn't care for sports, two: we were both destitute, and three: I was thinking, <em>"What NBA player would want you?"</em>. She didn't exercise, eat right or try to maintain good habits. I said, "Okay." and left it at that. A few weeks later, I stopped showing up for work, and our friendship ended without any need for closure.</p>

<p>Today, basketball is the only sport that I love. I love the Miami Heat and Caleb Martin, #16 😍. To me, he is so sexy and talented. Every time I see his pictures, my heart melts like chocolate 🍫. I love everything about him and enjoy the game more when he's playing in it.</p>
			 
			 <p>Meanwhile, I think back to my friend at the plant and what she said about wanting a basketball player. I never knew that I could dream about someone so out of my league, but now that I have, I wouldn't mind living in five-inch heels.</p>
