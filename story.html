			 <p><span class="highlight">I want a basketball player</span> 🏀 | Sat, February 26, 2022</p>
			 <p>A few years ago, I worked at a plant where I met a very tall girl. We became friends and started hanging out together. We hated working at the plant because the hours were long, the pay was low, and nearly all the men were discriminative. It didn't take me long to realize that I didn't belong there.</p>

<p>One day, I went out and about to try something new. Everything went well, so I introduced the new gig to my friend. She gave it a try, did well, and admitted that it wasn't alright with her. After confessing a few things, she told me, "I want a basketball player.".<br>Honestly, I didn't have positive feelings towards her when she said this to me because one: I didn't care for sports, two: we were both destitute, and three: I was thinking, <em>"What NBA player would want you?"</em>. She didn't exercise, eat right or try to maintain good habits. I said, "Okay." and left it at that. A few weeks later, I stopped showing up for work, and our friendship ended without any need for closure.</p>

<p>Today, basketball is the only sport that I love. I love the Miami Heat and Caleb Martin 😍. To me, he is so sexy and talented. Every time I see his pictures, my heart melts like chocolate 🍫. I love everything about him and enjoy the game more when he's playing in it.</p>
			 
			 <p>Meanwhile, I think back to my friend at the plant and what she said about wanting a basketball player. I never knew that I could dream about someone so out of my league, but now that I have, I wouldn't mind living in five-inch heels.</p>
