			 <p><span class="goodmorning">🌻 Good Morning Gorgeous</span> | Wed, February 16, 2022</p>
			 <p>I've been reading more books lately and spending more time exercising. Initially, my goal was to read one book every month and exercise three times a week. I'm happy that I have exceeded my goal because I'm learning more and seeing progress. I also feel more energized and spend my time learning Spanish and writing creatively. I've been planning activities and scheduling designated days to be off instead of waking up and letting my mood decide what to do. I feel balanced and happier with an element of creativity that I haven't felt in a long time.<br><br>I was driving in my car and heard Mary J. Blige's new song on the radio. Every time she gets to the chorus, I feel uplifted and pretty. The lyrics are so positive and relatable that I can't help but smile at all the times that other people, including me, at previous points in my life, would defeat my purpose and worth. It amazes me how I came from such low points in my life to be this person who feels happy and whole.</p>

			 <p>My Crush on Caleb Martin 🏀 | Sun, February 13, 2022</p>
		 <p>For the past couple of days, I've been crazy about Caleb Martin. He's an NBA player for the Miami Heat, #16. I was looking at his pictures and dreaming about what his life must be like, his body, and all the women that want him. He is so sexy and talented that he inspires me to shoot for more in life.<br><br>This morning, I was working out in the gym and thinking about how my efforts will pay off by summertime. I can't wait to catch a radiant tan by the pool, go back black, and get all my tattoos done. I've had miserable acne for the past two years, but now it's finally beginning to clear up. I will look great and feel confident in no time. Aside from my physical assets, I'm reading books, making plans, and finding ways to earn more income. I may not have a net worth of millions at any point in my life, but that's not to say that I won't try to earn a million or two in my lifetime.<br><br>I want the best life I can have and live with confidence that I deserve it.</p>
