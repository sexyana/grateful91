			 <p>So far, so good 😉 | Mon, February 28, 2022</p>
			 <p>I'm glad this month is over.</p><p>📚 Out of the five or six books I ordered, I read two. One of the books I read was about acquiring real estate. It was about how this man and his wife took out a loan from the bank, bought different properties, and managed various obstacles as a landlord. I didn't find it too interesting, so I threw it away. The other book is about creating an online business without physical merchandise. It was more of a step-by-step guide. Then, I started reading three books about investing that I will finish by the end of March.</p>
			 <p>I also worked out and jogged many miles. I'm proud to see results. My glutes have taken shape, and my upper body looks slimmer. I'm not far from where I need to be. I'm going to stop using the gym, run harder at the park, and work out at home from now on. My skin is looking healthier, too. I spent a lot on products and am using many creams at once. It has been painful, but the results are showing up as expected.</p>
			 <p>Aside from all that, I drank, slept, and talked way too much during the past weekends. I need to calm down because I get too excited and loud. I've cut back drinking to two glasses and have taken measures to talk less with lower volume.</p>
			 <p>What else? At times, I felt like I was losing motivation. For example, I walked at the park last night and thought about giving up. I could continue doing what I'm doing, settle, and never see the day of living in a highrise, driving a corvette, or retiring. Then, I came home, worked out, ate, showered, folded laundry, and went online. Somehow, motivation came back, and I reminded myself that these things take time. I could learn to have patience and invest in ideas that might turn out great for me. For a minute, I thought about going back into the world, but my wild opinions about people couldn't stay quiet. I've had many jobs, and one thing I know for sure is that more people are making a living instead of living a life. I don't hate what I do for work, but I know I can't do it forever. As far as my life goes, I'm thankful that it's good, although I feel that it can easily be a whole lot better.

			 <p>Heat @ Knicks 🏀 | Fri, February 25, 2022</p>
			 <p>That was a great game! Knicks fans are lame for booing Jimmy and Tyler, and Caleb looks soo handsome. I bought so much chicken before the game. I don't know how I'm going to eat it all. Tomorrow, I'm supposed to go bowling. I wish I could bring all this leftover chicken to the alley.</p><p style="text-align:center;">🐓___🐓___🐓</p><p>This entire week was not fun. I barely took appointments because it was too cold, and I broke out with hives. I took Blue to the shop and scheduled maintenance for her next week. I have to change her filters and get her washed because <span class="highlightblue">I love her.</span> Also, I finished reading a book and started on a new project that seems to be going well. It will take time to see results.</p>
