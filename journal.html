			 <p>Heat @ Knicks 🏀 | Fri, February 25, 2022</p>
			 <p>That was a great game! Knicks fans are lame for booing Jimmy and Tyler, and Caleb looks soo handsome. I bought so much chicken before the game. I don't know how I'm going to eat it all. Tomorrow, I'm supposed to go bowling. I wish I could bring all this leftover chicken to the alley.</p><p style="text-align:center;">🐓___🐓___🐓</p><p>This entire week was not fun. I barely took appointments because it was too cold, and I broke out with hives. I took Blue to the shop and scheduled maintenance for her next week. I have to change her filters and get her washed because <span class="highlightblue">I love her.</span> Also, I finished reading a book and started on a new project that seems to be going well. It will take time to see results.</p>
