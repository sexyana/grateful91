			 <p>My Crush on Caleb Martin 🏀 | Sun, February 13, 2022</p>
		 <p>For the past couple of days, I've been crazy about Caleb Martin. He's an NBA player for the Miami Heat, #16. I was looking at his pictures and dreaming about what his life must be like, his body, and all the women that want him. He is so sexy and talented that he inspires me to shoot for more in life.<br><br>This morning, I was working out in the gym and thinking about how my efforts will pay off by summertime. I can't wait to catch a radiant tan by the pool, go back black, and get all my tattoos done. I've had miserable acne for the past two years, but now it's finally beginning to clear up. I will look great and feel confident in no time. Aside from my physical assets, I'm reading books, making plans, and finding ways to earn more income. I may not have a net worth of millions at any point in my life, but that's not to say that I won't try to earn a million or two in my lifetime.<br><br>I want the best life I can have and live with confidence that I deserve it.</p>
