			<p><em>"Do it because you want to<br>
			and without expectations.<br>
			If it is reciprocated<br>
			then, perhaps<br>
			it might be worth keeping or looking into.<br>
			Otherwise, be glad it happened,<br>
				or not, and keep on..."</em></p>

			<p><em>"Also, a lot of things in life<br>
			aren't worth holding on to<br>
			and many things come in disguise<br>
				<strong>but</strong>, if your faith is real<br>
			and your intentions are good<br>
				then, you <strong>should</strong> be good.<br>
				(Hands me a paper) That's for your next appointment."</em></p>

			<p><span class="pink">Heart</span> | 05/27/2022</p>
			<p><em>Heart to heart<br>
			Because...<br><br>
			<strong>Love</strong> is real<br>
			<strong>God</strong> is there<br>
			And every heartbeat counts<br>
			But nothing is forever<br><br>
			A cigarette burns out<br>
			The party is over<br>
			Sex doesn't last<br>
			And a kiss will fade<br><br>

			Caught in my feelings<br>
			And the rest is business<br><br>
			Either way<br>
			I'm holding on<br>
			To let it go<br>
			And set myself free</em></p>

			<p><strong>Broke</strong> 💔 | 05/20/2022</p>
				<p>Sometimes, I lose myself<br>
				like seasons come and go<br>
				I wanna break faces<br>
				in my palm for them to know<br>
					<em>I am who and what I am</em><br>
				Broken rocks in the street<br>
				Had I known any better<br>
				I'd knock them in they teeth<br>
				I'd do it now without the rivers<br>
				running dry from my eyes<br>
				nothing worst than sleeping<br>
				as my enemy at night<br>
				and before I met them<br>
				or found music as a friend<br>
				I thought I'd come up Broke<br>
				messed up and dead again<br>
				I'd catch myself like a fish<br>
				tryna swim upstream<br>
				💎 for diamonds and roses 🌹<br>
				~ to live and die as a queen ~<br>
				But, Broke as I was then<br>
					and Broke, I will not be<br>
				in tribute to my heart<br>
					for beating inside of me</p>

			<p>☀️</p>
			<p><em>I wish I could spend<br>
				the rest of my life<br>
				with you<br>
				like how the moon meets the sun<br>
				when the night is brand new.</p>
			<p>I wish you knew<br>
				how much I thought of you<br>
				and how much it would mean<br>
				if you felt the same way, too.</p>
			<p>Oh...</p>
			<p>I love being a girl<br>
				like a butterfly in the sky<br>
				kissing leaves and dreaming<br>
				as if I'd never die.</p>
			<p>I'd flutter up to the Sun<br>
				with Love for the ferocious,<br>fiery one<br>
			and say...</p>
			<p>Scorch my wings to ashes<br>
				and catch my heart ablaze...<br>
				cause I wanna burn with you<br>
				for the rest of my days.</em></p>

			 <p><span class="blue">b u o y a n t</span> | 03/27/2022</p>
			<p>i used to think it mattered<br>
			but most of it doesn't<br>🎈</p>

			<p>i keep my hair up<br>
			and lounge in menswear</p>

			<p>ginseng tea and toasted bagel<br>
			talking to myself at the table</p>

			<p>i don't sleep much anymore</p>

			<p><span class="blue">Good Enough</span> | 03/21/2022</p>
			<p>You are a <strong>good</strong> person.<br>
			You are true to yourself.<br>
			You stand by what you believe.<br>
			We can disagree and still hangout.<br>
			You don't use me.<br>
			You don't treat me like a clown.<br>
			You never accuse me of being<br>
			Someone other than myself.<br>
			You are <strong>kind.</strong><br>
			You have <em>class</em> and <em>style.</em><br>
			I hide no secrets from you.<br>
			I keep the ones you tell me.<br>
			I accept you for who you are.<br>
			You make me laugh and smile.<br>
			You are someone I can talk to.<br>
			Let's be around each other<br>
			In more days than there are years.<br>
			Days add up like memories and<br>
			Life is only as <strong>good</strong> as we are.</p>

			 <p><span class="pink">An Angel's Gift</span> | 03/06/2022</p>
			 	<p>💖<br>
				true love is a gift<br>
				a piece of an angel's heart<br>
				it is gentle and clever<br>
				like passion from Cupid's dart<br>
				so hot and flammable<br>
				like a good man's cologne<br>
				authentic like a scorpion<br>
				love makes itself known<br>
				too wise to be proud<br>
				and fearless of humiliation<br>
				to love is to learn how<br>
				to live life with determination<br>
				cause when the world disagrees<br>
				an angel knows without doubt<br>
				blessed with faith and gratitude<br>
				what true love is about</p>

			 <p><span class="blue">The Promise</span> | 03/01/2022</p>
			 <p>there is a small rabbit<br>
				 beneath where<br>
				 the moon is shining<br>
				 in the city park near the street<br>
				 praying for a <em>silver lining</em><br>
				 and in the darkest hour<br>
				 breathing cold air<br>
				 <strong>s o m e b o d y</strong><br>
				 is outside waiting<br>
				 who promised<br>
				 <em>to be there</em><br>🐇
