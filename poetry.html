            <p>5 AM<br><br>

                I dreamed I had 12 likes<br>
                my instagram post.<br><br>

                in reality<br>
                I am lucky to have<br>
                hot tea and toast for breakfast.<br><br>

                the journey to be someone<br>
                has so many avenues<br>
                filled with everything<br>
                from boredom to excitement<br>
                and the frustration....<br><br>

                i wish someone offered me<br>
                a $2.1 million dollar contract 🏀<br><br>

                some people say he's just casual<br>
                but i don't care. clearly, no matter<br>
                how much you accomplish<br>
                no matter how much you prove<br>
                to yourself and to the world<br><br>

                people will always<br>
                find something to say<br><br>

                be like nike.<br>
                just do it.</p>

            <p>there's a donut shop<br>
                down the street<br>
                and everybody goes there.<br>
                the drive-thru lane is short<br>
                so all the cars wait<br>
                behind each other<br>
                in the street.</p>

            <p>do you like donuts?<br>
                i used to eat donuts.</p>

            <p>they don't live very long<br>
                but lots of people love them<br>
                before they are made<br>
                and even after they are gone.</p>
