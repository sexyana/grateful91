			<p class="dates">thurs, june 23, 2022</p>   

			<p>5 AM<br><br>

			I dreamed I had 12 likes<br>
			my instagram post.<br><br>

			in reality<br>
			I am lucky to have<br>
			hot tea and toast for breakfast.<br><br>

			the journey to be anyone<br>
			has so many avenues<br>
			filled with everything<br>
			from boredom to excitement<br>
			and the frustration....<br><br>

			i wish someone offered me<br>
			a $2.1 million dollar contract 🏀<br><br>

			some people say he's just casual<br>
			but i don't care. clearly, no matter<br>
			how much you accomplish.<br>
			no matter how much you prove<br>
			to yourself and to the world<br><br>

			people will always<br>
			find something to say<br><br>
				
			be like nike.<br>
			just do it.</p>

			<p>there's a donut shop<br>
				down the street<br>
				and everybody goes there.<br>
				the drive-thru lane is short<br>
				so all the cars wait<br>
				behind each other<br>
				in the street.</p>

				<p>do you like donuts?<br>
					i used to eat donuts.</p>

				<p>they don't live very long<br>
				but lots of people love them<br>
				before they are made<br>
					and even after they are gone.</p>

			violet, gold, and teal<br>
			i am in love with you.</p>
