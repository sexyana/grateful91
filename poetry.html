			 <p>Real | Mon, February 21, 2022</p>
			 <p>I'm suppose to be real<br>
			 And I keep myself in check.<br>
			 I go jogging when I feel low<br>
			 Write when I need to escape<br>
			 Rest when I need a break<br>
			 And give my worries to God.<br><br>
			 When I think about my future<br>
			 I lay my head on the bed.<br>
			 I trust in the blanket of comfort<br>
				that God puts over my head.<br>
				 Everyday is a gift, but<br>
				 There are days I can't shine.<br>
				 I feel wrapped in emotions<br>
				 And naked the entire time.<br><br>
				 I'm suppose to be real<br>
				 And check in on myself<br>
				 If God didn't love me<br>
				 <strong>For me</strong><br>
				 Then I'd be somebody else.

		 <p>Dreams | Tues, February 15, 2022</p>
			 <p>I dream of a man<br>
				 who looks into my eyes<br>
				 the way the sun shines through<br>
				 the windows of my highrise.<br>
				 A satin, red robe<br>
				 is my cape of love.<br>
				 In search of life's meaning,<br>
				 I <strong>dream</strong><br>
				 with <em>Faith</em> and <em>God</em> above.<br>
				 As I run along the waters<br>
				 and catch myself a tan,<br>
				 I smile in these moments<br>
				 and feel as happy as a clam.<br>
				 Kissing to life everyday<br>
				 with shellfish and chardonnay,<br>
				 I spend time with good friends<br>
				 and work smart along the way.<br>
				 I dream to stand <strong>tall</strong><br>
				 in a beautiful dress,<br>
				 forgiving my reflection<br>
				 for all the times I felt less.<br>
				 I close my eyes to imagine<br>
				 how my life could be<br>
				 and remember to stay grateful<br>
				 for all that <em>God</em> gives to me.
