			 <p><strong>Crushing On Him 🏀</strong> | 03/15/2022</p>
<p><em>Caleb Martin #16<br>For the Miami Heat 🔥</em></p> 
				<p>Damn. He's so fine! Everything about him turns me on. You know what I want to do. 😈 I'm rarely wild about any guys. If only he knew.</p> 

<p><em>God, can you hear me?</em></p> 

<p>It's been a month and I'm still crushing on him. What's wrong with me? I've never had the hots for a basketball player or any man in the public eye, except for Maluma and Nicky Jam. I crushed on both of them at the same time for less than 2 weeks. Caleb is different. I think he's special. Because of him, I have courage to pursue my real dreams. I'll get there as soon as I can.</p> 

<p><em>God, if you can hear me...</em></p> 

<p>I'm trying. You've always given me a hand. Give me a sign if I'm being crazy, but if I'm not wrong, can you calm the current?</p>

			 	<p>💖<br>
				true love is a gift<br>
				a piece of an angel's heart<br>
				it is gentle and clever<br>
				like passion from Cupid's dart<br>
				so hot and flammable<br>
				like a good man's cologne<br>
				authentic like a scorpion<br>
				love makes itself known<br>
				too wise to be proud<br>
				and fearless of humiliation<br>
				to love is to learn how<br>
				to live life with determination<br>
				cause when the world disagrees<br>
				an angel knows without doubt<br>
				blessed with faith and gratitude<br>
				what true love is about</p>

			 <p>there is a small rabbit<br>
				 beneath where<br>
				 the moon is shining<br>
				 in the city park near the street<br>
				 praying for a <em>silver lining</em><br>
				 and in the darkest hour<br>
				 breathing cold air<br>
				 <strong>s o m e b o d y</strong><br>
				 is outside waiting<br>
				 who promised<br>
				 <em>to be there</em><br>🐇
