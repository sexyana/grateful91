		     <p><strong>The Best Summer Ever 😎</strong> - June 6, 2022 | 7:02 am</p>
		     <p>It's a new month already. Welcome, June. I'm glad to be here and excited to share new things. Last month, I made a song called <em>Lemon Yellow Hummer</em>. I'm proud of that song, and it makes me happy to listen to it. So, what have I accomplished since then?</p>

<p>I've realized that making music <em>just</em> makes me happy. It's another outlet for me to express my creativity and is not exactly suitable for me as a career. I've invested a lot of time and resources into pursuing music and will continue to make music as a hobby.</p>

<p>As far as my career planning goes, I've decided to pursue computer programming. I've been on and off with this subject for the past three years. I spent a few hours researching on job boards and freelancing platforms to see what employers were seeking in a full-stack developer. Everything from knowing React, Node, JavaScript, TypeScript, MySQL, and specific languages to the company's needs, plus a bachelor's degree and a few years in the field, were either required or strongly preferred.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I contacted the junior college near me and decided to enroll in classes for this upcoming semester. I filled out the applications, gathered my documents, and failed the math test. It's been ten years since the last time I solved an algebraic equation that I understood. As I write this, I have a tab open on YouTube about Advanced Algebra and Functions. I have to retake the test and do well or settle with paying for and attending remedial math classes.</p>

<p>Then, I went on Udemy and bought all the fundamental programming languages I mentioned earlier. A total of 505 hours that I'm taking hour by hour. By the time the fall semester begins, I can build small projects on my own while working towards my degree.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I made a checklist for everything I wanted to accomplish in a single day because everything great begins with a single effort to try. If I finish these courses by mid-July, I might be able to release an album before school starts!</p>

                 <p><strong>The Beginning of Besties & Homegurls</strong> - May 6, 2022 | 8:04 pm</p>
                 <p>These past nights, I've been up and awake till 3am. I just finished watching online videos made by Clinton Sparks, in this 3-day workshop. It was about understanding music as a business and how to get started with it. Before I decided to pursue music as a career, I knew that it was going to be the biggest investment of my life.</p>
    
                     <p>Just last month, I spent over $600 on FL Studio, a midi keyboard, headphones, microphone, accessories and online courses. This month, I've already gone through $500 on paperwork fees. After figuring the numbers out, I was speechless. I can't believe I'm going through with this.</p>
                     <p>I spent all my time in the month of April getting to know Fl Studio, finding my rhythm and making beats. I bought two courses that showed me the basics and tips of how to use it. I watched videos on youtube. I searched through Instagram looking for beatmakers. I signed up and watched a video on selling beats by Robin Wesley. With everything that I had, I played around with the DAW and made 5 different beats.
                         <ul>
                             <li>Listen on Youtube</li>
                            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/-rs4uiQFDqg">Gone Like Summer</a></li>
                            <li>Listen on Soundcloud</li>
                            <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/djsexyana/5am-crimes?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">5am Crimes</a></li>

                         </ul>
    
                         At first, I was going for the electronic and hip-hop style. Then, I was writing lyrics and trying to emulate songs by Alicia Keys and Cannons. It didn't work out too well. I started taking a course to learn how to play piano. It was fun, but I stopped practicing and ended up with these 5 beats that proved to me just how amazing and frustrating it is to become a pro at making music. I even wrote a song for "Gone Like Summer" and recorded it a million times. The result did not turn out well, but I learned a bit about vocal mixing and plugins. With all that done...
                     </p>
                     <p>I went into May with a different perspective. First of all, I'm not Alicia Keys. I can't make beats like Cannons or DJ Snake. <strong>I can't,</strong> but what I can do is be me. So, I sat down at my desk. Beginning a new beat scared me because I never knew what to start with. This time around, I picked a drum sample, a synth for the chords and a bass. I put a few patterns together and in a matter of minutes, I had a rhythm. The melody gave me an unexpected vibe that strangely resonated with me. I opened notepad and literally, the lyrics wrote itself.</p>
                     <p>I wrote, recorded, produced and completed my first real song in the first week of May. I spent all day getting the vocals and lyrics right. I experimented with a new plugin that was driving me crazy in the first 2 days, but I had to know it because it <em>produced</em> the sound I wanted.</p>
                     <p>The song is inspired by my friends or, as I refer to them in the song, my besties and homegurls.</p>

       <p><strong>Crushing On Him 🏀</strong> | 03/15/2022</p>
			 <p><em>Caleb Martin #16<br>For the Miami Heat 🔥</em></p> 
			 <p>Damn. He's so fine! Everything about him turns me on.<br>
				 You know what I want to do.<br>
				 😈 I'm rarely wild about any guys. If only he knew.</p> 

			 <p><em>God, can you hear me?</em></p> 

			 <p>It's been a month and I'm still crushing on him. What's wrong with me?<br>
				 I've never had the hots for a basketball player or any man in the public eye, except for Maluma and Nicky Jam.<br>
				 I crushed on both of them at the same time for less than 2 weeks.<br>
				 Caleb is different. I think he's special. Because of him, I have courage to pursue my real dreams.<br>
				 I'll get there as soon as I can.</p> 

		<p><em>God, if you can hear me...</em></p> 

		<p>I'm trying.<br>
			You've always given me a hand.<br>
			Give me a sign if I'm being crazy, but if I'm not wrong, can you calm the current?</p> 

		<p>😎</p>
