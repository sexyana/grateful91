            <p>It's a new month already. Welcome, June. I'm glad to be here and excited to share new things. Last month,
                I
                made a song called <span style="color:yellow;">Lemon Yellow Hummer</span>. I'm proud of that song, and
                it
                makes me happy to listen to it. So, what have I accomplished since then? I've realized that making music
                <em>just</em> makes me happy. It's another outlet for me to express my
                creativity and is not exactly suitable for me as a career. I've invested a lot of time and resources
                into
                pursuing music and will continue to make music as a hobby...<a href="blog.html">Read More</a>
