             <p>There are things in life meant to be<br>
                like when you came into my world<br>
                I never thought that we would<br>
                become more than we are as friends<br>
                but you bring out the best in me<br>
                at first I didn't know what to think<br>
                we were looking for the same things<br>
                and then you gave me everything<br>
                to believe that you were all<br>
                that I need</p>
                
                <p>and you're here with me<br>
                from now through eternity<br>
                i never want to turn back<br>
                to change anything<br>
                all the bad times have gone<br>
                and I've been waiting<br>
                to have found you all along<br>
                we can take on the world<br>
                being as strong, in my eyes<br>
                you are loved and you belong<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>There are those that never say<br>
                exactly what they're feeling<br>
                but when we are together, you show<br>
                me the meaning of a woman being<br>
                true and faithful to everything<br>
                she believes<br>
                you're the inspiration I look to<br>
                you encourage me to trust in<br>
                what could be, what will be<br>
                and just believe</p>

			 <p>there is a small rabbit<br>
				 beneath where the moon is shining<br>
				 in the city park near the street<br>
				 praying for a <em>silver lining</em><br>
				 and in the darkest hour<br>
				 breathing cold air is<br>
				 <strong>s o m e b o d y</strong><br>
				 outside waiting<br>
				 who promised<br>
				 <em>to be there</em>

				 I dreamed to be an ______.<br>
				 In Fashion.<br>
				 My Passion.<br>
				 Some things don't change.<br>
				 I still <span class="highlight">love 2 write</span><br>
				 minus pay and recognition.<br>
				 Inspired by <strong>magic</strong><br>
				 I know as my <em>intuition.</em><br>
				 I am who <strong>I am.</strong><br>
				 But forgot who <span class="highlight">I was.</span><br>
				 Eccentric.<br>
				 Reluctant.<br>
				 All. <em>Just.</em> Because.<br>
